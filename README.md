# Abhaykr45-Face-recognition-based-attendance-system
This project presents an AI-based smart attendance system that automates the process of marking attendance using face recognition and real-time liveness detection. It eliminates the need for manual entries or RFID cards and ensures secure attendance by validating that the face is real (not a photo or video).
