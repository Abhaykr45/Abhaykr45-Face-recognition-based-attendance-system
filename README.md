# Abhaykr45-Face-recognition-based-attendance-system
This project is an AI-powered attendance system that uses face recognition and real-time liveness detection to automatically record attendance securely and efficiently
The system captures the userâ€™s face using a webcam and identifies them using the Facenet model from the DeepFace library. To prevent spoofing through photos or videos, it includes liveness detection using MediaPipe, which verifies natural actions like eye blinks and head movements before allowing attendance.
